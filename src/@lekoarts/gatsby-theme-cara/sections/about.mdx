## About Me

I am a technically articulate, quality driven web developer delivering a broad range of creative technology solutions that support a plethora of applications. Furthermore, as an innovative technical architect and highly accurate analyst, I am accustomed to creating and maintaining databases, dashboards, and content management systems.

I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, NodeJS, and other tools and frameworks. Feel free to reach out for any questions and further information.

Outside of coding, I am a foodie, a huge football and basketball fanatic, and am a travel enthusiast who loves to explore and embrace the various cultures our world has to offer.
